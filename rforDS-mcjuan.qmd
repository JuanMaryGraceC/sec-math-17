# The Tidyverse

To install the tidyverse package use the code:

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

```         
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

we also installed other packages by typing in the console the following code:

`install.packages(c("arrow", "babynames", "curl","duckdb","gapminder" "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "hexbin", "janitor", "Lahman","leaflet", "maps", "nycflights13", "openxlsx", "palmerpenguins","repurrrsive", "tidymodels", "writexl"))`
